# ChatGPT Prompts in BaseLink

Here is some code for a programming language we are calling "link"

```
form connection
  task close, like void
  task commit, like void
  task db-name, like string
  task escapes, like string
  task last-insert-id, like int
  task quotes, like string
  task requests, like result-set
  task rollback, like void
  task start-transaction, like void
```

It is a simple tree structure. The "form" is a class, and a "task" is a
method or function if not on a class. Can you define a user form using
this syntax?
