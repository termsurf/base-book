# Working with Files in BaseNote

BaseNote provides comprehensive functionality for working with files in
your applications. Files play a crucial role in data storage,
processing, and interaction with the underlying system. Let's explore
the various operations you can perform with files using BaseNote.

### Creating a File

To create a new file, you can use the following code:

```link
load @termsurf/bolt/code/file
  find save

call save, <foo.txt>, <hello world>
```

This code loads the `@termsurf/bolt/code/file` module, invokes the
`save` command, and provides the desired filename (`foo.txt`) and
content (`hello world`). This creates a new file with the specified name
and writes the content into it.

### Reading a File

To read the contents of a file, you can use the following code:

```link
load @termsurf/bolt/code/file
  find read

call read, <foo.txt>
```

This code loads the `@termsurf/bolt/code/file` module, executes the
`read` command, and specifies the file (`foo.txt`) from which you want
to retrieve the content. The command returns the content of the file as
a result.

### Creating a File Read Stream

If you need to process a file in a streaming manner, you can create a
file read stream using the following code:

```link
load @termsurf/bolt/code/file/stream/read
  find make

save flow, call make, <foo.txt>
walk list, loan flow
  hook tick
    take chunk, name tick
    show <{chunk}>
```

This code loads the `@termsurf/bolt/code/file/stream/read` module,
invokes the `make` command to create a read stream for the specified
file (`foo.txt`), and then iterates over the chunks of data in the
stream. The `hook tick` captures each chunk of data, and you can perform
actions with the chunks as needed.

### Creating a File Write Stream

For writing data to a file in a streaming manner, you can use the
following code:

```link
load @termsurf/bolt/code/file/stream/write
  find make

save flow, call make, <foo.txt>
call flow/save, <hello world>
call flow/halt # end
```

This code loads the `@termsurf/bolt/code/file/stream/write` module,
creates a write stream for the specified file (`foo.txt`), and then
writes the content (`hello world`) to the stream using the `flow/save`
command. Finally, the `flow/halt` command is called to signal the end of
writing and close the stream.

### Creating a Folder

To create a new folder (directory), you can use the following code:

```link
load @termsurf/bolt/code/folder
  find save

call save, <my-directory>
```

This code loads the `@termsurf/bolt/code/folder` module, executes the
`save` command, and specifies the name (`my-directory`) for the new
folder. This creates a new directory with the provided name in the
current working directory.

By leveraging these file-related features in BaseNote, you can
effectively manage file operations, such as creating, reading,
streaming, and organizing files and directories within your
applications. Whether you need to store data, process files
sequentially, or manipulate file system structures, BaseNote provides
the necessary tools to handle file-related tasks efficiently and
reliably.
