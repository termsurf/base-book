# The `code` file in BaseLink

The `code` file is a type of file where you can do all of the standard
"programming" things, such as defining types and writing functions and
variables and such. It differs from the `deck` file type, which is a
specific configuration file which is extra concise (its own DSL), or the
`book` file type, which is for efficiently writing books.
